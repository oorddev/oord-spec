# Spec Status

**Current state:** DRAFT

This repository is under active development. Until a tagged release exists (e.g., `v1.0.0`),
there are **no compatibility guarantees** for external consumers.

When a stable release is cut:
- The tag name is the canonical spec version (e.g., `v1.0.0`)
- Schema + prose at that tag define the released contract
